OBSERVER PATTERN
- defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

1. The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects.
2. Subjects update Observers using a common interface.
3. Observers of any concrete type can participate in the pattern as long as they implement the Observer interface.
4. Observers are loosely coupled in that the Subject knows nothing about them, other than that they implement the Observer interface.
5. You can push or pull data from the Subject when using the pattern (pull is considered more "correct").
6. Swing makes heavy use of the Observer Pattern, as do many GUI frameworks.
7. You'll also find the pattern in many other places, including RxJava, JavaBeans, and RMI, as well as in other language frameworks, like Cocoa, Swift, and JavaScript events.
8. The Observer Pattern is related to the Publish/Subscribe Pattern, which is for more complex situations with multiple Subjects and/or multiple message types.
9. The Observer Pattern is a commonly used pattern, and we'll see it again when we learn about Model-View-Controller.
